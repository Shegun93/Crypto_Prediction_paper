## Overview
The project explores the application of deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM and GRU, to predict cryptocurrency prices. The notebook provided (Paper-BTC-original.ipynb) demonstrates the LSTM method discussed in the paper, including data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of results.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical price data for:

Bitcoin (BTC): dataset.csv

Ethereum (ETH): Dataset_eth.csv

Each dataset includes the following features:

Date: The date of the recorded data.

Open: The opening price of the cryptocurrency on the given date.

High: The highest price of the cryptocurrency on the given date.

Low: The lowest price of the cryptocurrency on the given date.

Close: The closing price of the cryptocurrency on the given date.

Adj Close: The adjusted closing price of the cryptocurrency on the given date.

Volume: The trading volume of the cryptocurrency on the given date.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

NumPy
